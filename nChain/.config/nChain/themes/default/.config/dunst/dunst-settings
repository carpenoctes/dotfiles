    # Which monitor should the notifications be displayed on.
    monitor = 0

    # Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
    #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
    #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
    #   none: don't follow anything
    #
    # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
    # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
    #
    # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
    # will be ignored.
    follow = keyboard

    # Show how many messages are currently hidden (because of
    # notification_limit).
    indicate_hidden = yes

    # Sort messages by urgency.
    sort = yes

    # Don't remove messages, if the user is idle (no mouse or keyboard input)
    # for longer than idle_threshold seconds.
    # Set to 0 to disable.
    # Transient notifications ignore this setting.
    idle_threshold = 120

    # Scale factor. It is auto-detected if value is 0.
    #scale = 0

    # Maximum number of notification (0 means no limit)
    notification_limit = 10

    ### Text ###

    # The spacing between lines.  If the height is smaller than the
    # font height, it will get raised to the font height.
    line_height = 0


    # Possible values are:
    # full: Allow a small subset of html markup in notifications:
    #        <b>bold</b>
    #        <i>italic</i>
    #        <s>strikethrough</s>
    #        <u>underline</u>
    #
    #        For a complete reference see
    #        <http://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html>.
    #
    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
    #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the
    #        server. Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is
    #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
    #
    # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
    #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
    #        capability if this is set as a global setting.
    #
    # It's important to note that markup inside the format option will be parsed
    # regardless of what this is set to.
    markup = full

    ### History ###

    # Should a notification popped up from history be sticky or timeout
    # as if it would normally do.
    sticky_history = yes

    # Maximum amount of notifications kept in history
    history_length = 50

    ### Misc/Advanced ###

    # dmenu path.
    dmenu = /usr/bin/dmenu -p dunst:

    # Browser for opening urls in context menu.
    browser = /usr/bin/firefox -new-tab

    # Always run rule-defined scripts, even if the notification is suppressed
    always_run_script = true

    # Define the title of the windows spawned by dunst
    title = Dunst

    # Define the class of the windows spawned by dunst
    class = Dunst

    # Print a notification on startup.
    # This is mainly for error detection, since dbus (re-)starts dunst
    # automatically after a crash.
    # startup_notification = false
    
    # Ignore the dbus closeNotification message.
    # Useful to enforce the timeout set by dunst configuration. Without this
    # parameter, an application may close the notification sent before the
    # user defined timeout.
    ignore_dbusclose = false

    #To match with regex for rules
    enable_posix_regex = true
    
    ### Wayland ###
    # These settings are Wayland-specific. They have no effect when using X11

    # Uncomment this if you want to let notications appear under fullscreen
    # applications (default: overlay)
    # layer = top


    # Set this to true to use X11 output on Wayland.
    #force_xwayland = false

    ### Legacy

    # Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support.
    # This setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that
    # do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly
    # discouraged.
    #
    # By enabling this setting dunst will not be able to detect when a monitor
    # is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
    # layout changes.
    force_xinerama = false

    ### Shortcuts

    # Shortcuts are specified as [modifier+][modifier+]...key
    # Available modifiers are "ctrl", "mod1" (the alt-key), "mod2",
    # "mod3" and "mod4" (windows-key).
    # Xev might be helpful to find names for keys.

    # Close notification.
    close = ctrl+space

    # Close all notifications.
    close_all = ctrl+shift+z

    # Redisplay last message(s).
    # On the US keyboard layout "grave" is normally above TAB and left
    # of "1". Make sure this key actually exists on your keyboard layout,
    # e.g. check output of 'xmodmap -pke'
    history = mod4+z

    # Context menu.
    context = mod4+period

    ### mouse

    # Defines list of actions for each mouse event
    # Possible values are:
    # * none: Don't do anything.
    # * do_action: Invoke the action determined by the action_name rule. If there is no
    #              such action, open the context menu.
    # * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple
    #             ones, open the context menu.
    # * close_current: Close current notification.
    # * close_all: Close all notifications.
    # * context: Open context menu for the notification.
    # * context_all: Open context menu for all notifications.
    # These values can be strung together for each mouse event, and
    # will be executed in sequence.
    mouse_left_click = do_action, close_current
    mouse_middle_click = close_current
    mouse_right_click = close_all

# Experimental features that may or may not work correctly. Do not expect them
# to have a consistent behaviour across releases.
[experimental]
    # Calculate the dpi to use on a per-monitor basis.
    # If this setting is enabled the Xft.dpi value will be ignored and instead
    # dunst will attempt to calculate an appropriate dpi value for each monitor
    # using the resolution and physical size. This might be useful in setups
    # where there are multiple screens with very different dpi values.
    per_monitor_dpi = false



# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
# Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "category",
# "msg_urgency" and you can override the "timeout", "urgency", "foreground",
# "background", "new_icon" and "format".
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
